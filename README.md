# Palindrome Game

What is a palindrome? A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as 'madam' or 'racecar'.

This game checks whether a word is palindrome or not. Users can pass a word by an argument variable passed in the CLI command. The game then splits the users word into an array of characters, reverses the array before stringifying the reversed array.

The game then compares the reversed word with the original word. Lastly, a message is printed for both true and false outcomes.
